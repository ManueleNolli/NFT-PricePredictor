## Description

This project is a price predictor for NFTs. It uses a dataset of NFTs sold on the OpenSea marketplace. The dataset is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harrywang/crypto-coven). The dataset contains ~10000 NFTs with their attributes and their price. 

The project is divided in two three parts: 

1. Data analysis and preprocessing
2. Price prediction model
3. Classification model (only for a didactic purpose)


## Models

In the project I esplicitly used different models to predict or classify the data. The models are:

- Linear Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree
- *Hashing*
- KNN

In addition, I used UMAP to reduce the dimensionality of the data and to visualize it in 2D.

##  Future work

In the future, it will be interesting to analyze the price of the NFTs based on the artist and the popularity of the artist. In addition, it will be interesting to analyze the price of the NFTs based on the category of the NFTs.
